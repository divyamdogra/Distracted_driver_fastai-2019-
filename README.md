# distracted_driver_fastai-2019-
This Project is done on Google Colaboratory on FAST.AI v3.
In this competition you are given driver images, each taken in a car with a driver doing something in the car (texting, eating, talking on the phone, makeup, reaching behind, etc). Your goal is to predict the likelihood of what the driver is doing in each picture. 


The 10 classes to predict are:

c0: safe driving
c1: texting - right
c2: talking on the phone - right
c3: texting - left
c4: talking on the phone - left
c5: operating the radio
c6: drinking
c7: reaching behind
c8: hair and makeup
c9: talking to passenger
